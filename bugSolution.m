To solve the retain cycle problem, use `weak` references to the delegate in the class where the delegate is used.  To prevent block-related memory issues, use `__weak` in blocks to reference objects in the surrounding scope. Ensure that blocks are only copied when necessary.  Proper use of `@property` with appropriate attributes (`strong`, `weak`, `copy`, `assign`) is also crucial for correct memory management.  Always carefully examine object lifetimes and consider using instruments such as Leaks to detect memory issues.
