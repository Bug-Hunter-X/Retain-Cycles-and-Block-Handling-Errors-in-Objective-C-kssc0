In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error involves incorrect handling of object ownership and memory management, particularly when dealing with delegates or blocks.  For example, retaining a delegate strongly in a class can lead to retain cycles, preventing objects from being deallocated, and eventually resulting in memory leaks.  Another example is using `copy` instead of `strong` when assigning a block, which can cause issues with the block's lifetime and unexpectedly prevent deallocation.
