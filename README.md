This repository demonstrates a common error in Objective-C related to memory management, specifically retain cycles and incorrect block handling. The `bug.m` file showcases the problematic code that leads to memory leaks. The solution is provided in `bugSolution.m`, which illustrates proper memory management techniques to prevent retain cycles and ensure correct object lifecycles.
